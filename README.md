# Telecom-Churn-Analysis:
Analysis of the data of a telecom company (Orange S.A) for the factors of the causes of churn.

**Introduction:**

In the telecom sector customer churn is a major problem. Because of customer churn (or low retention of an existing customer of the company), a telecom service provider company faces huge financial losses. So, in this project, I have tried to find out the factors that cause customer churn.
For the customer churn analysis, we have given a clean dataset of a French multinational telecommunications company Orange S.A (formerly France Telecom S.A). 


**Objective:**

We will try to find out the factors that cause customer churn.So, the company can use those factors to decrease customer churn and increase the retention rate of their existing customer.

**Factors obtained from the analysis:** 

      1. Price of the international plan
      2. Price of the voicemail plan (for user who uses more than 20 voicemail)
      3. Connectivity issue in some states
      4. Price of the day call (for user who makes more call)
      5. Quality of customer service call

      1. The dataset contains details of a total of 3333 customers in 51 states.
      2. The number of churns and non-churned customers is 483 and 2850 respectively.
      3. The percentage of churned and non-churned customers is 14.49% and 85.51% respectively.
